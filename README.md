## ✨ What Makes This Special

This isn't your typical portfolio template. The hero section features a **custom pixel-art animation** where I prototyped each grid cell in Figma first, then brought it to life with JavaScript and GSAP.

**Why it's cool:**
- 🎮 Each pixel is individually animated in sequence
- 🎨 Designed in Figma before coding (design-first approach)
- ⚡ Smooth 60fps animation using GSAP
- 📱 Fully responsive across all devices

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Animations:** GSAP (ScrollTrigger, Timeline)  
**Design:** Figma (prototyping), Custom pixel grid  
**Hosting:** Vercel

**No frameworks. Just vanilla JS and creative problem-solving.**

## 💡 The Creative Process

### Hero Animation Breakdown

1. **Design Phase**  
   - Prototyped the pixel grid in Figma
   - Tested different letter formations and spacing
   - Planned the animation sequence frame-by-frame

2. **Development**  
   - Built a CSS grid system for the pixels
   - Used GSAP timeline to animate each cell individually
   - Added stagger effects for smooth transitions
   - Optimized for performance (60fps on all devices)

3. **Why This Matters**  
   Most developers skip the design phase. I spent time in Figma first to ensure the animation would look exactly right before writing any code.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building Pixanaive taught me:

- **Design → Code workflow** – Prototyping animations in Figma before building saves time
- **GSAP mastery** – Complex timeline sequences with stagger effects
- **Performance optimization** – Keeping 60fps with hundreds of animated elements
- **Vanilla JS power** – You don't need React for impressive web experiences
